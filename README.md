## About ARDA
ARDA was developed to address the need for comprehensive and up-to-date information on internet topology and connectivity in Africa, from an African perspective. The platform aims to offer easily accessible data that goes beyond basic metrics, providing insights into the direct and indirect connections between networks through Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) and their geographic reach. By analyzing publicly available BGP data, ARDA is able to track the active interconnection of networks across the region and highlight specific points of connection. This progressive and visual data on interconnection status, presented from the viewpoint of each country's IXP, eliminates the need for resource-intensive data processing and enables users to monitor progress, identify gaps, and explore opportunities. In the spirit of supporting interconnection research and development, ARDA offers this valuable information free of charge, making it an invaluable resource for understanding and advancing network connectivity in Africa.
